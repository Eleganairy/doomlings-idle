## The Origin Story

### The Meteorite Impact

A meteorite carrying alien life crashed onto Earth. Among the debris were small, strange creatures called **Slimes** - simple organisms that had traveled through space for millennia. These slimes possess a unique ability: they can **absorb and adapt** to the traits of living things around them.

### The Awakening

Upon landing on Earth, the slimes began to feed on the meteorite fragments scattered across the landscape. The meteorite's energy had already begun affecting Earth's ecosystem - plants became sentient, animals grew aggressive, and nature itself turned hostile.

The slimes, feeding on this cosmic energy, started developing new abilities and forms. Each trait they absorb from the Earth's creatures makes them stronger, giving them new powers to survive in this transformed world.

## The World

<!-- TODO: Add more detailed world descriptions for each area -->

### Area 1: Grasslands

_"First contact with Earth's surface"_

The initial landing zone. Rolling green hills and meadows now populated by hostile wildlife. The creatures here - hedgehogs, snails, mice, rabbits, and foxes - have all been affected by the meteorite's energy and attack anything that moves.

**Enemies:**

- Spiky Hedgehog (Fast)
- Snail (Tank)
- Field Mouse (Standard)
- Wild Rabbit (Strong)
- Red Fox (Rare, Strong)

**Boss:** Forest Guardian
_The first major threat - a massive creature that guards the entrance to the deeper forests._

### Area 2: Living Forest

_"The plants have become sentient and hostile from the meteor's energy"_

Beyond the grasslands lies a forest where the trees themselves have awakened. The meteor's energy has mutated the plant life into aggressive, mobile creatures.

<!-- TODO: Expand on the Living Forest story -->

---

### Area 3: Mushroom Caverns

_"Underground fungal network mutated by the meteor debris"_

Deep beneath the surface, a network of caves filled with bioluminescent fungi. The meteor debris that fell underground has created a strange ecosystem of mutated mushrooms and spore creatures.

**Boss:** Mushroom King
_Ruler of the underground fungal network._

<!-- TODO: Add future areas and their stories -->

## The Slimes

The playable characters are **Slimes** - alien organisms from the meteorite. As they absorb traits from Earth's creatures, they evolve into specialized forms:

### Basic Slime

_"The basic slime that flew with the meteorite to Earth. It does not look like it can do anything special. Anyway, let's feed it meteorite, that is a good idea."_

The original form. A simple, adaptable creature that serves as the foundation for all evolution.

### Druid Slime

_"Using the energy of living beings and trees, this slime is able to use the energy it gains for good. Instead of dealing damage, this slime can heal its allies and has strong abilities in return for weaker base stats."_

A support-focused evolution that draws power from nature to heal allies.

### Electric Slime

_"Using the electricity from the planet and from the life around it, this slime generates so much energy that it is completely made out of electricity. This slime can attack fast and generate strong attacks that damage all enemies."_

An offensive evolution that harnesses electrical energy for devastating AoE attacks.

### Fortified Slime

_"Scraping the bark of the fortified trees brought to life a tanky slime that can take more damage and shield itself to protect himself from taking damage. Those trees came in handy after all."_

A defensive evolution with high health and shield abilities.

## Core Concepts

### Energy

Energy is the life force collected from defeated enemies. It's used to power upgrades and unlock new abilities.

### Traits

As slimes evolve, they develop **Traits** - permanent abilities unlocked through gameplay achievements. Traits unlock new upgrade paths and represent the slime's adaptation to Earth.

### Meteorite Fragments

<!-- TODO: Define what meteorite fragments do in gameplay -->

Rare cosmic material that can be used for powerful upgrades or special crafting.

## Themes & Tone

- **Evolution & Adaptation**: The core theme - growing stronger by absorbing traits from enemies
- **Cosmic Horror Lite**: Something alien has landed, and the world is changing
- **Nature Corrupted**: Earth's creatures have become hostile due to the meteorite's influence
- **Idle Progression**: A sense of constant growth even when not actively playing

## TODO: Story Elements to Define

- [ ] Why are the slimes fighting? (Survival? Territorial expansion? Collecting meteorite?)
- [ ] Is there an end goal? (Return to space? Dominate Earth? Find other slimes?)
- [ ] What is the significance of bosses? (Guardians? Lieutenants of a greater threat?)
- [ ] Are there friendly NPCs or is everything hostile?
- [ ] What happened to humans? (Pre-human timeline? Humans fled? Humans are...something else now?)
